This folder is just a placeholder for the verilog model of the Ram memory APS25608N-OBR-BD, whose datasheet can currently be downloaded from here: https://www.apmemory.com/wp-content/uploads/APM_PSRAM_OPI_Xccela-APS25608N-OBRx-v1.0-PKG.pdf

The system verilog module is not provided, hence keep USE_PSRAM=0 in tb_pulp.
